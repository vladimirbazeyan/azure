#Install Azure CLI
#There are two options to install the Azure CLI on your system. You can download an install script that runs the install commands for #you, or you can execute the install commands yourself in a step-by-step process. Both methods are provided here:

#Option 1: Install with one command
#The easiest way to install the Azure CLI is through a script maintained by the Azure CLI team. This script runs all installation #commands in one step. This script is downloaded via curl and piped directly to bash to install the CLI.

#If you wish to inspect the contents of the script yourself before executing, download the script first using curl and inspect it in #your favorite text editor.

Bash

#Copy

curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash

#Option 2: Step-by-step installation instructions
#If you prefer a step-by-step installation process, complete the following steps to install the Azure CLI.

#Get packages needed for the installation process:

Bash

####

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl apt-transport-https lsb-release gnupg
#Download and install the Microsoft signing key:


####

sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -sLS https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc |
    gpg --dearmor |
    sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/microsoft.gpg > /dev/null
sudo chmod go+r /etc/apt/keyrings/microsoft.gpg

### Add the Azure CLI software repository:


#####
AZ_DIST=$(lsb_release -cs)
echo "deb [arch=`dpkg --print-architecture` signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/microsoft.gpg] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/azure-cli/ $AZ_DIST main" |
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/azure-cli.list
Update repository information and install the azure-cli package:



### Copy
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install azure-cli
Install specific version
Configure the azure-cli repository information as shown previously. Available versions can be found at Azure CLI release notes.

View available versions of the Azure CLI.

Bash

Copy
apt-cache policy azure-cli
Install a specific version.

Bash

Copy
# Obtain the currently installed distribution
AZ_DIST=$(lsb_release -cs)

# Store an Azure CLI version of choice
AZ_VER=2.51.0

# Install a specific version
sudo apt-get install azure-cli=$AZ_VER-1~$AZ_DIST
To install a specific version without variables, replace the Azure CLI version and Linux distribution name shown:

Bash

Copy
sudo apt-get install azure-cli=2.51.0-1~bullseye
If you receive error message Unable to locate package azure-cli, the azure-cli repository information is not configured. Follow the steps given in Option 2: Step-by-step installation instructions.

If you receive error message Version x.xx.x-1~distributionName for azure-cli was not found, use lsb_release -cs to find the distribution you're running.

Update Azure CLI
Beginning with version 2.11.0, the Azure CLI provides an in-tool command to update to the latest version.

Azure CLI

Copy
az upgrade
This command also updates all installed extensions by default. For more az upgrade options, see the command reference page. For Azure CLI versions prior to 2.11.0, update by reinstalling as described in Install the Azure CLI.

You can also use apt-get upgrade to update the CLI package. This command upgrades all of the installed packages on your system that haven't had a dependency change.

Bash

Copy
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
To upgrade the CLI only, use apt-get install.

Bash

Copy
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install --only-upgrade -y azure-cli
